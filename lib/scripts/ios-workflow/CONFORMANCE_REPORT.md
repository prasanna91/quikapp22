## 🎯 Conformance Status

### ✅ **FULLY CONFORMANT**
- All scripts referenced in `codemagic.yaml` exist in the centralized location
- No missing scripts detected
- All paths have been updated from `lib/scripts/ios/` to `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/`
- Utility files remain in `lib/scripts/utils/` for shared use

### 🔄 **Workflow Integration**
- **codemagic.yaml** properly references all scripts from `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/`
- **Permission settings** correctly target the centralized directory
- **Script execution** paths are consistent throughout the workflow

### 🛡️ **Modern Code Signing**
- All scripts support modern App Store Connect API approach
- Traditional certificate handling has been removed
- Bundle ID validation is properly configured

## 📋 Recommendations

1. **✅ Conformance Verified** - All required scripts are present and properly configured
2. **✅ Path Consistency** - All references in codemagic.yaml point to the correct centralized location
3. **✅ Modern Approach** - Workflow uses App Store Connect API for code signing
4. **✅ Shared Utilities** - Common utilities remain in `lib/scripts/utils/` for shared use

## 🎉 Conclusion

The iOS workflow is **fully conformant** with the `codemagic.yaml` configuration. All scripts are properly centralized in `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/` while maintaining shared utilities in `lib/scripts/utils/`. The workflow is ready for production use with modern App Store Connect API code signing.
