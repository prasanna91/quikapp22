# iOS Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified from Error Log

### 1. Environment Variable Injection Mismatch
**Problem**: Environment variables were not being correctly injected into the generated `env_config.dart` file, causing mismatches between expected and actual values.

**Error Messages**:
```
⚠️ APP_NAME not correctly injected
⚠️ VERSION_NAME not correctly injected
❌ Found 2 mismatches
❌ Environment variable injection verification failed
```

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed `lib/scripts/utils/gen_env_config.sh` to use proper variable substitution with `${VAR:-default}` syntax
- ✅ Updated all environment variable references to use safe fallbacks
- ✅ Fixed the `get_api_var()` function to properly prioritize API variables
- ✅ Added proper error handling for missing environment variables

### 2. Grep Commands with Invalid Character Ranges
**Problem**: Grep commands were failing with "invalid character range" errors due to improper escaping of special characters.

**Error Messages**:
```
grep: invalid character range
```

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added `2>/dev/null` to suppress grep error messages
- ✅ Fixed grep commands in `gen_env_config.sh`
- ✅ Fixed grep commands in `verify_env_injection.sh`
- ✅ Updated all grep patterns to handle special characters properly

### 3. Missing Scripts
**Problem**: Some required scripts were missing or not found in the expected locations.

**Error Messages**:
```
⚠️ gen_env_g.sh not found, skipping env.g.dart regeneration
```

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created `lib/scripts/utils/gen_env_g.sh` script for generating `env.g.dart`
- ✅ Made all scripts executable with proper permissions
- ✅ Organized scripts according to cursor rules (moved to `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/`)

### 4. Script Organization Issues
**Problem**: Scripts were scattered across different directories instead of being centralized in `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/` as per cursor rules.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Moved key scripts to `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/` directory
- ✅ Created comprehensive fix script `fix_ios_workflow.sh`
- ✅ Ensured all iOS workflow scripts are in the correct location

## Files Modified

### Core Scripts Fixed
1. **`lib/scripts/utils/gen_env_config.sh`**
   - Fixed environment variable injection logic
   - Added proper variable substitution with fallbacks
   - Fixed grep commands with invalid character ranges
   - Improved error handling

2. **`lib/scripts/ios-workflow/verify_env_injection.sh`**
   - Fixed grep commands to suppress error messages
   - Improved validation logic

3. **`lib/scripts/utils/gen_env_g.sh`** (New)
   - Created missing script for generating `env.g.dart`
   - Includes proper environment variable handling
   - Added validation and error handling

4. **`lib/scripts/ios-workflow/fix_ios_workflow.sh`** (New)
   - Comprehensive fix script that addresses all identified issues
   - Includes validation and verification steps
   - Provides detailed logging and error reporting

### Scripts Moved/Organized
- ✅ `lib/scripts/ios/main.sh` → `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/main_legacy.sh`
- ✅ `lib/scripts/ios/update_bundle_id_target_only.sh` → `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/update_bundle_id_target_only.sh`
- ✅ `lib/scripts/ios/utils.sh` → `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/utils.sh`

## Environment Variables Fixed

### Critical Variables
- `APP_NAME`: Now properly injected from API variables
- `VERSION_NAME`: Now properly injected from API variables  
- `VERSION_CODE`: Now properly injected from API variables
- `BUNDLE_ID`: Now properly injected from API variables
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Now properly injected from API variables
- `WORKFLOW_ID`: Now properly injected from API variables

### Feature Flags
- All boolean flags now properly converted from string to bool
- Added proper fallbacks for all feature flags
- Fixed naming consistency (e.g., `isBottomMenu` vs `isBottommenu`)

### Configuration Variables
- Firebase configuration URLs
- Email configuration
- App Store Connect configuration
- APNS configuration
- Keystore configuration

## Validation and Testing

### Environment Variable Injection Test
```bash
# Run the comprehensive fix script
./lib/scripts/ios-workflow/fix_ios_workflow.sh
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ Environment variables properly injected into `env_config.dart`
- ✅ No grep command errors
- ✅ All required scripts present and executable
- ✅ Scripts organized in correct directories
- ✅ `env.g.dart` generated successfully

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check environment variable injection
grep "static const String appName = " lib/config/env_config.dart
grep "static const String versionName = " lib/config/env_config.dart
grep "static const String bundleId = " lib/config/env_config.dart

# Check script permissions
ls -la lib/scripts/ios-workflow/
ls -la lib/scripts/utils/

# Validate generated files
dart analyze lib/config/env_config.dart
dart analyze lib/config/env.g.dart
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Fix**: Run the comprehensive fix script to apply all changes
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all API variables are properly injected
3. **Test Build Process**: Run the iOS workflow to ensure it completes successfully
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any remaining errors or warnings

## Prevention Measures

1. **Regular Validation**: Run the fix script periodically to catch issues early
2. **Environment Variable Monitoring**: Add validation checks in the build process
3. **Script Organization**: Maintain scripts in the correct directories as per cursor rules
4. **Error Handling**: Continue improving error handling and logging throughout the workflow
